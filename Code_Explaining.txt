**Code Explanation:**

---

This program is designed to process an image by filtering specific colors and then using a robot to recreate the image in a drawing program.

1. **Image Import:** The image is imported from the local computer.

2. **Color Filtering:** The program isolates the desired colors by converting all other colors in the image to white. Each color is then stored in a separate variable named after the color.

3. **Image Conversion:** Each color-specific image is converted into a grayscale image, followed by a binary matrix where white pixels are represented by ones and black pixels (the original color) by zeros.

4. **Color Detection:** The binary matrix is analyzed to check for the presence of the original color. If more than five black pixels (representing the original color) are detected, the robot proceeds with the drawing.

5. **Drawing Process:**
   - **Color Selection:** The robot switches tabs to the drawing program and selects the appropriate color by moving the mouse to predefined coordinates based on the user's PC setup. The color is selected by clicking the mouse.
   - **Drawing Execution:** The mouse then moves to the predefined starting position, and the robot begins drawing by clicking the mouse at each black pixel location in the matrix. The drawing appears in the selected color.
   
6. **Repeating the Process:** This process is repeated for each color detected in the image. If a specific color is not found in the image, the program skips it and moves on to the next color.
